        <h1><b><i><center>‘One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world.’</b></i> </h1>
                   <br>These are the words of Malala Yousafzai, a brave young girl who stood up against Taliban  in Pakistan, fighting for her right to education and went on to become the youngest Nobel laureate in the world. Her passion for education and dedication to the cause has made Malala an international symbol in the fight for education of girl child. Girl child education in India is important for an equitable nation.</br>
                   Data from a research paper published in International Journal of Research in Economics & Social Sciences states that literacy rate of girls has gone up from 8.86 % in 1951 to 54.16% in 2001 and increased to 65.5% as per 2011 census report. While this is an increase over the literacy rate of girls in the past, when compared to the boys’ literacy rate which stood at 82.1% (Census report 2011) it highlights the huge gap that still exists in girl child education in India. The Global Gender Gap Report (2021) ranked India at 114 out of 156 countries based on educational attainment.</center>

                   <br> <p> Barriers to girls' education – like poverty, child marriage and gender-based violence – vary among countries and communities. Poor families often favour boys when investing in education. In some places, schools do not meet the safety, hygiene or sanitation needs of girls.
                     so to overcome these problems the following steps can be taken- </br>
                  <br>   1.  Street plays, Movies, Dances and Art
                        are one of the best forms of communication. Awarness can be spread not only by speeches or Ppts but also through different art forms. The primary goal of a street play is taking a social message to a large group of people.These plays can really stir up emotions, create awareness and lead to positive changes. It not only enlightens people but gives each one of us an oppurtunity to help other. These plays can create a positive impact and can lead to drastic changes in our society. Free street plays can be conducted in cities and towns at fairs or public areas to spread awarness and necessity for female education.</br>
                <br>     2.  Role Models:
                     To show the common people that women are capable of providing better economic returns, Female Army officers, athletes, Engineers, Doctors, Ministers, IAS, Lawyers etc. can be made to talk in schools and fairs to encourage girls to persue higher education. Teach girls and boys both skills which are directly applicable in real life, making special efforts to make it more engaging and interesting. By creating an enviornment of inspiration and hope girls and boys will be motivated to persue higher education. Provding scholarship and grants upto  10 lakh ruppees to girls after 10th grade and 12th grade can ease the burden on parents to pay for their child's education. Women can be independent and give better economic returns and not be considered a burden. Classes of self defence can be conducted in school for self protection AND NOT FOR FIGHTING PURPOSES</br>
                  <br>   3. Resources:
                     Girl child usually is unable to go to school because they have to help in household work and unable to give econcomic returns if they are invested in as human capital. Girls can be provided free sanitary pads, medications, contraceptial services and legal help (if forced into marriage or facing ), textbooks and clean water and clothes. These will encourage young girls and women to attend to educational instituions for free basic necessities. Knowledge of working of instituions and police will help reduce the crime rates and provide assistance to young girls and women who are victims of violence and abuse.  </br>
                  <br> 4. Easy Accessible Grants:
                  Scholarships and Grants for higher education is extremly competitive, many families (APL & BPL) feel women would not be suited for such scholarships and rather stay at home. To make this process less stressful women can be provided 1-10 lakh scholarships for all girls (getting above 89.83%) and their choice to take it or not. Making most grants and scholarships easily accessible to both boys and girls can encourage poor families to send their children to colleges and universities and persue higher education. National Scholarship Portal can provide scholarships including tution fee, residency and books.
