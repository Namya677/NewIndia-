    <h2> <center> What is the problem with education in India?</center></h2>
      <p>
        <h4> 1.	Lack of budget and resources</h4>
        Due to the lack of educational infrastructure many children are still not able to get education. Educators have been unable to overcome all financial and technological problems, many students have to travel long distances to attend school.
        During the COVID-19 lockdown, more than 168 million children dropped out of school as they did not have proper internet connection and devices or financial problems within the family.
        In public schools do not have enough teachers and facilities like class rooms, black boards, drinking water and sanitary facilities.

        <h4>2.	Cost of higher education</h4>
        Unfortunately many children are unable to peruse higher education, mainly due to the cost. Privatization of advanced education has helped the development of benefit greedy business people. Now advanced education is a much expensive undertaking.

      <p>
        <h4>3.	Neglect of Indian Languages</h4>
        The education in schools generally gives importance to English medium thus students are not developing foundational literacy and numerical skills. And then they are piled on with more material in English and as a result, kids mainly from government schools and poorer backgrounds were suffering a lot because of this. Standard distributions are not accessible in native Indian languages.

       <p>
        <h4>4.	Lack of good teachers</h4>
         Lack of trained and skilled teachers is another problem mostly faced by our education system. Besides the lack of skilled teachers, they are also burdened with a non-academic workload which diverges their focus from teaching.
       </p>
       <p>
        <h4>5. Discouraging Girl Education</h4>
         <p> Many girls in India are married at a young age and drop out of school after they complete their primary education due to societal pressures or early pregnancies. Child labor and lack of feminine hygiene products keep girls from coming to school, and contribute to the literacy rates and continuous lack of education.</p>
