    <p> Encouraging girl education will ensure equality among the citizens and equal oppurtunties. Higher female literacy rates reduce child mortality. Education lowers crime rates. Girls' education reduces inequality in society. Education empowers marginalised women and helps them build better futures for themselves and their families. It is extremly important for a girl to be aware and educated, we can do this by- Awarness Campaigns in diffrent villages, towns and cities ephasizing on the need for girl education, discussing menstral and physical health, dangers of unprotected sex, making contraceptial services available to all girls for free at schools and universities and preventing child marriage. Girls can be provided free sanitary pads, contraceptial services(pregancy pills) and free medical services at schools and universities. Reduction in schools or college fee by 46%, providing additional scholarships for girls attending institutions of higher education. To encourage higher education, girls can learn relevant skills that employers actually demand, or that they can use in launching their own business through workshops and classes. This can help them practice a certain craft and trian for jobs. Self-employment and etreprenur skills can be taught in classes. Officers of the Department of Literacy and Education will ensure compalsary education for children ages 6-14 (Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right); emphasize and make stronger laws against child marriage. </p>
