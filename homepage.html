        <h2>Agenda 2030</h2>
        <p>On 1 January 2016,  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by Countries in September 2015 at an historic UN Summit,  came into force.  These new Goals apply to all nations who are supposed to achieve the SDGs in the coming 15 years.

The new Goals are unique in that they call for action by all countries, poor, rich and middle-income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and addresses a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection. India played a prominent role in the formulation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 and much of the country’s National Development Agenda is mirrored in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). India clearly believes that Resilient economies and poverty eradication can only be achieved by safeguarding the environment, protecting the ecosystems that sustain human well-being and mitigating climate change and its impacts.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Education plays a major role in a nation’s development and is a basic right of every human being. Education increases the propensity for better employment opportunities. Not only education makes a smart, informed population, but it boosts economic growth and increases the GDP of a country. It allows people to live a healthy and happy lifestyle with a high standard of living. Hence for a country like India, education has immense value in the development of the country. See the education page for problems and possible solutions.</p>
