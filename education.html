      <h2> <center> What is the problem with education in India?</center></h2>
        <p>
          <h4> 1.	Lack of budget and resources</h4>
          Due to the lack of educational infrastructure many children are still not able to get education. Educators have been unable to overcome all financial and technological problems, many students have to travel long distances to attend school.
          During the COVID-19 lockdown, more than 168 million children dropped out of school as they did not have proper internet connection and devices or financial problems within the family.
          In public schools do not have enough teachers and facilities like class rooms, black boards, drinking water and sanitary facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h4>2.	Cost of higher education</h4>
          Unfortunately many children are unable to peruse higher education, mainly due to the cost. Privatization of advanced education has helped the development of benefit greedy business people. Now advanced education is a much expensive undertaking.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h4>3.	Neglect of Indian Languages</h4>
          The education in schools generally gives importance to English medium thus students are not developing foundational literacy and numerical skills. And then they are piled on with more material in English and as a result, kids mainly from government schools and poorer backgrounds were suffering a lot because of this. Standard distributions are not accessible in native Indian languages.
        </p>
         <p>
          <h4>4.	Lack of good teachers</h4>
           Lack of trained and skilled teachers is another problem mostly faced by our education system. Besides the lack of skilled teachers, they are also burdened with a non-academic workload which diverges their focus from teaching.

      <h2> <center> Suggestions/Solutions</h2>

        <h4> 1.Formation of Education Committee for base level </h4>
        <p>
            Under the Department of Education and Literacy smaller committees will be put in place to ensure proper quality of education and education facilities in each school.
            City level committee - Central Education Committee;
            Village/Town level - Village Education Committee. The head of the CEC and VEC will work with department of education and literacy in each state and gram panchayats respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          What will these committees do?
          They will conduct suprise checks in Government/Public and Private Schools. If there are missing teachers or bad infrastructure, the CEC or VEC members will take the school under processing and re-locate teachers and/or buy facilities using government money for Education(â‚¹112,899 crore which will be distributed according to need or through donations given by NGOs)
        . Awarness campaigns will be conducted in public areas, this is to ensure that parents realise the importance of education and will send their children to school.</p>

        <h4> 2. Children Must be Motivated to come to School</h4>
        <p>Children need to be motivated to attend school- in 1995 children where provided mid-day meal which encouraged them to go to school. Similarly children can now be provided with opportunities to directly earn money in school or develop skills to earn money in school this can be done by conducting workshops during school hours (sewing, creating their own water filter tank so they can use rainwater for drinking, Schooling projects that have the long-term aim of benefiting communities from the growth of an educated younger generation that can create local business initiatives, provide work opportunities and boost the labour market), helping in cleaning of school during/after school, competitions to earn money (football competition/ math quiz), teaching kids of younger ages(tutoring), providing free drinking facilities & sanitation facilities (including free pads for young girls)
        </p>

        <h4>3. Reducing Cost of higher education and books </h4>
        <p> Scholarships will be extended for ALP and BLP families earning less that Rs 20,500 per month, they will also be provided reservation in classes IX-XII, government colleges and govermnent funded colleges. Students of this crietia will be provided free books, study material, uniforms and recidency[including 3 meals, water and electricity](if required).
        </p>

        <h4> 4. Learning in Native Language </h4>
        <p> After school English classes conducted in government/ public schools. Teaching in native language of state in government schools in villages and cities, additional assistance provided to children with physical disabilities. After school classes to better understand English medium while also learning and understanding subjects in their native language.
        </p>

        <h4> 5. Good Quality Teachers</h4>
        <p>All teachers teaching in Government/Public Schools will be required to take a 1 month course under Deparetment of Education and Literacy in each state, to improve their teaching skills. They will be trained and assigned according to need by the Central Education Committee or the Village Education Committee. The teachers attendence will also be marked and checked by the Deparetment of Education and Literacy of the respective state. Night School Sessions will be conducted in Public/Government schools so that Adults who are uneducated or not completed their diploma can also learn.</p>

        <h4> 6. Encourage Girl Education </h4>
        <p> Encouraging girl education will ensure equality among the citizens and equal oppurtunties. Higher female literacy rates reduce child mortality. Education lowers crime rates. Girls' education reduces inequality in society. Education empowers marginalised women and helps them build better futures for themselves and their families. It is extremly important for a girl to be aware and educated, we can do this by- Awarness Campaigns in diffrent villages, towns and cities ephasizing on the need for girl education, discussing menstral and physical health, dangers of unprotected sex, making contraceptial services available to all girls for free at schools and universities and preventing child marriage. Girls can be provided free sanitary pads, contraceptial services(pregancy pills) and free medical services at schools and universities. Reduction in schools or college fee by 46%, providing additional scholarships for girls attending institutions of higher education. To encourage higher education, girls can learn relevant skills that employers actually demand, or that they can use in launching their own business through workshops and classes. This can help them practice a certain craft and trian for jobs. Self-employment and etreprenur skills can be taught in classes. Officers of the Department of Literacy and Education will ensure compalsary education for children ages 6-14 (Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right); emphasize and make stronger laws against child marriage. </p>

        <h4> 7. Orphanages </h4>
        <p> The state governments can make child labour laws stronger; provide free education and good quality education for children in orphanages (under CEC) or by recruting teachers to teach at orphanages. Proving additional scholarships and grants to orphanges, conducting awarness sessions and encouraging children to be independent
        </p>
        <h4> Self - Awarness</h4>
        <p> At the end, the government can only help a limited amount, for such schemes to be successful parents have to send their children to school.
